## Quick Reference: What Users Define vs What System Computes

| User Defines | System Computes |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Bundles (groups of sites/apps) | Block Windows (inverse of allowed) |
| Allowed Windows (when NOT blocked) | Segments (time slices across bundles) |
| Commitment (locks schedule) | Merged Blocklists (combined entries) |
| | Pre-Authorized Schedules (daemon registration) |
